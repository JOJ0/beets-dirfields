Here are some plugins I wrote for my personal use. They might not be very
stable so use them at your own risk...

## Plugins
Currently the following plugins are available:
* [arttools](https://github.com/mried/beetsplug/wiki/arttools): A toolbox for album art handling.
* [autosingleton](https://github.com/mried/beetsplug/wiki/autosingleton): Automatically decide if files should be imported as singletons.
* [dirfields](https://github.com/mried/beetsplug/wiki/dirfields): Adds a field for each directory of its original path.
* [regexfilefilter](https://github.com/mried/beetsplug/wiki/regexfilefilter): Filter the files to import using regular expressions.
 
See the [Wiki](https://github.com/mried/beetsplug/wiki) for more details and how to configure them.
